I am an applied mathematician using a combination of data analysis methods and mechanistic differential equation modeling, primarily in biomedical research. My passion is translating across domains, formalizing concepts mathematically to uncover new understanding in scientific areas, as well as helping other scientists and mathematicians to understand each others' domain terminology. In my current position at Mayo Clinic, I work with cancer biologists, clinical neuro-oncologists and neuro-surgeons, as well as other applied mathematicians, bioinformaticists, and bioengineers, in a collective effort to gain new insights for treating glioblastoma. 

As a former patient caregiver, I am also interested in philosophy of medicine and support efforts toward improved quality of life and early incorporation of palliative care and social support for patients and their families.

I earned my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Washington in 2016. Further details about my education, training, awards, teaching and mentorship can be found in my [CV](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QrdhDdS6prloPvgqMRKkRCua_FznYopZ).
