[//]: # (Currently aiming for high level, who I boil down to professionally, as opposed to a short bio. But want feedback on effectiveness from others.)

#### *Solving biological puzzles with mathematical tools.*

Math and medicine have been my primary intellectual interests since childhood. As a former patient caregiver, I am deeply passionate about making discoveries that improve clinical care using the unique lens that comes from the intersection of these two knowledge bases.

I earned my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Washington in 2016, where I focused on mathematical neuro-oncology for my dissertation, [*Multi-scale modeling of paracrine PDGF-driven glioma growth and invasion*](http://hdl.handle.net/1773/38058). During my graduate studies, I spent six months in a research pathology lab, learning to culture and retrovirally transduce cells, perform Western blots, *and more!*,  to better understand the perspective of my scientific collaborators.
