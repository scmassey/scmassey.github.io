#### Assessing the impact of drug delivery versus sensitivity in glioblastoma treatment response
Glioblastoma is the most common type of brain cancer (and also the most aggressive). As part of a multi-center effort, we are trying to determine how the incomplete breakdown of the blood-brain barrier affects drug distribution in tumors. There are many ways we are studying this question, but my particular role has been using noninvasive imaging data from preclinical models to quantitatively assess the contributions of drug distribution and resistance to heterogeneous treatment outcomes.

#### Environmentally-driven glioma growth via paracrine PDGF signaling
My dissertation research focused on the role of paracrine platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling in the microenvironment of experimental proneural glioblastoma. Through that work, I demonstrated through mechanistic mathematical modeling that tumors can be driven by changes in the environment, causing "normal" cells to behave like cancer without undergoing mutation. These partial differential equation models were parameterized using experimental data from a PDGF-driven preclinical glioma model, developed by Peter Canoll and his lab at Columbia University College of Medicine. If you are interested in learning more, [my dissertation can be downloaded from the University of Washington](http://hdl.handle.net/1773/38058), and I also published several papers and abstracts on the topic. 

#### Sensitivity analysis via Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficients
As part of model development, it can be helpful to study the sensitivity of the model outputs to the parameters. This is particularly true for parameter values that naturally vary according to some distribution or for parameters values that are difficult to estimate experimentally. One approach for investingating this sensitivity is to use Latin hypercube sampling of the model parameters to run monte carlo simulations and then assessing the partial rank correlation of the parameters with simulation results. I have applied this method for a number of models and am developing resources to make this technique easier to learn and utilize. *Stay tuned!*

#### Sex differences in neuroimmunology
Through my work with glioblastoma, I've become increasingly interested in the neuroimmune system and biological sex differences, and how variation in normal or healthy biological functioning translates to different incidence and outcome in disease. I am looking to collaborate on projects in this area that will benefit from my quanititave analytical skills to improve precision medicine.
